I am from Grand Rapids, MI.  After high school, I attended Grand Rapids Community College before transferring to the University of Michigan (Go Blue!).  After graduation I worked for Environment Michigan and then accepted admission to the University of Illinois. Now I am the Senior Metrics Advisor at USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Rights, and Governance.

<!--I pursue research with two goals in mind: (1) develop and refine theories that teach us about political behavior and (2) bring evidence to policy debates.  Those goals have attracted me to survey experiments and collaborations with NGOs and governments to implement field experiments, but I am also interested in longitudinal analyses, lab experiments, and causal inference statistics.-->

In my free time, I can often be found backpacking through forests and mountains.  Some of my favorite spots are the hot springs in the western United States, like [shower bath hot springs](https://www.10adventures.com/hikes/salmon-challis-national-forest/shower-bath-hot-springs-hike/).  There are few things more satisfying in life than a brutal hike followed by a soak in one of natureâ€™s own hot tubs. If I am not hiking, I am probably playing sports or board games.

I also love cooking and introducing people to Armenian food (I am half-Armenian).  Armenian cuisine is a delicious blend of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors and styles, using whatever ingredients are in season and plenty of herbs and seasonings.  If you want to try Armenian food, I recommend [Gutsy Gourmet](https://www.thegutsygourmet.net/armenian.html), and especially the lamb shank recipe!
