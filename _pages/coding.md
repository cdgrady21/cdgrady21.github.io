Many colleagues have asked me about resources for learning R, Python, and causal inference statistics. I'm not expert enough in Python to recommend good learning resources, but here are some good resources for learning the basics of R, how to use R for particular tasks, and for learning the basics of causal inference.

These are all free, online resources. They give you code that you can easily copy & paste into your R console, which allows you to play around with R and learn by doing. I recommend starting with the first resource (R for Data Science) and then selecting other options based on your learning interests.



********



**Getting started**: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz)

This online book will walk you through everything you need to get started using R for data science. It is comprehensive and will provide you with a solid foundation for learning to do other tasks in R.  Start here.


**Machine learning**: [Basics of Statistical Learning](https://statisticallearning.org/index.html)

This online version of a stats course at the University of Illinois provides "a broad introduction to machine learning from the perspective of a statistician who uses R and emphasizes practice over theory".


**Distributed Computing**: [Mastering Spark with R](https://therinspark.com/intro.html)

This excellent online textbook will teach you how to analyze "big data" using R.  It assumes no prior knowledge of R or of distributed computing.


**Data Visualizations**: [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/)

This is "a practical guide that provides more than 150 recipes to help you generate high-quality graphs quickly, without having to comb through all the details of R’s graphing systems."


**Web Applications**: [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/)

"This book is designed to take you from knowing nothing about Shiny to being an expert developer who can write large complex apps that are still maintainable and performant. You’ll gain a deep understanding of the reactive programming model that underlies Shiny, as well as building a tool box of useful techniques to solve common app challenges."


**Causal Inference**: [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) 

This excellent book "introduces students and practitioners to the methods necessary to arrive at meaningful answers to the questions of causation, using a range of modeling techniques and coding instructions for both the R and the Stata programming languages."  Go here to learn about matching, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, synthetic controls, and more.

**Causal Inference**: [Causal Inference for The Brave and True](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html)

This book describes itself as "A light-hearted yet rigorous approach to learning impact estimation and sensitivity analysis. Everything in Python and with as many memes as I could find."  I fully endorse that description. It is somewhat similar to the Causal Inference Mixtape, but with two major differences: (1) the coding examples are in Python, and (2) it's second part also goes into some predictive modeling and machine learning applications.


**General coding assistance**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en)

There are many good AI tools for coding assistance. I recommend Cursor. It provides a text editor where you can write your code, and a built in AI chat window that can see the code in the text editor, recommend improvements, and even copy the improvements directly into the text editor. It also allows you to select from several AI language models.



Good luck!
