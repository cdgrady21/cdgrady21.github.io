## This Week in Social Science

I co-write a weekly research newsletter called _This Week in Social Science_.  You can find it on my [Substack](https://substack.com/@cdgrady21). We summarize two social science articles each week, saying what the researchers did, what they found, and why it matters.

## Bureau of Democracy, Rights, and Governance

Some of my writing while at USAID was for public consumption. I've posted a few of them here.

*NOTE: The United States Agency for International Development hass been shut down, so the public links to these writings may break in the near future.*

### Weekly "Facty Friday" Newsletter

I founded USAID's weekly research newsletter, Facty Friday. Facty Friday summarized two academic studies in 300 words or less each week, telling readers what the researchers did, what they found, and why it matters for international development. My colleagues and I wrote these every week for almost three years and posted them on [DRGLinks](https://www.drglinks.org/facty-friday/) as a public good for the international development community.  If DRGLinks is taken down and you'd like access, contact me by email: cdgrady21[at]gmail[dot]com.
