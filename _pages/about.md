I am a political scientist with substantive interests in behavioral science, international development, intergroup conflict, and taxation<!--psychology, media and observational learning, learning and behavior -->. My methodological expertise is in experimental design, survey research, and causal inference. I am generally interested in interventions to improve human well-being and in manifestations of commitment problems and collective action problems.

I co-write [_This Week in Social Science_](https://substack.com/@twissweekly) with my colleague, [Levi Adelman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xIv67rwAAAAJ&hl=en). We summarize two social science articles each week, saying what the researchers did, what they found, and why it matters. _TWISS_ makes the latest insights from social science accessible to anyone.

I have collaborated with NGOs Equal Access International and Mercy Corps on academic and policy work throughout Africa.  My dissertation work was featured in the article ["Why Do We See So Many Things as 'Us vs. Them'?"](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/things-that-divide-us) in the April 2018 issue of National Geographic and published in [_Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2304882120) in 2023.

My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, International Foundation for Electoral Systems, and Evidence in Governance and Politics.  I received my AA from Grand Rapids Community College, my BA in Political Science from the University of Michigan, and my PhD in Political Science from the University of Illinois.

I was formerly Senior Metrics Advisor for USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Rights, and Governance. I am currently a partner and board member for [EI Research Partners](https://www.eiresearchpartners.com/partners). I also serve on the Board of Directors for Evidence in Governance and Politics [(EGAP)](https://egap.org/about/). I am also a Research Affiliate for [MIT GOV/LAB](https://mitgovlab.org/people/chris-grady/) and a Research Fellow at the Research on International Policy Implementation Lab ([RIPIL](https://www.ripilab.com/about)) at American University.
