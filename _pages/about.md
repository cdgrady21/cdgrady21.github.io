I am a political scientist with interests in international development, intergroup conflict, political psychology, media and observational learning, and quantitative methods.  My dissertation examined the effects of conflict prevention programs in northern Nigeria.  I have collaborated with NGOs Equal Access International and Mercy Corps on academic and policy work throughout Africa.  My dissertation work was featured in the article "Why Do We See So Many Things as 'Us vs. Them'?" in the April 2018 issue of National Geographic.

My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, International Foundation for Electoral Systems, and Evidence in Governance and Politics.  I received my AA from Grand Rapids Community College, my BA in Political Science from the University of Michigan, and my PhD in Political Science from the University of Illinois.

I am now the Senior Metrics Advisor for USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Rights, and Governance.
